And this is generally true, if you're trying to software render for a normal PC graphics API like OpenGL.  But we're emulating a GS.  That's okay though, it's still a just bunch of triangles, right?  PCSX2 has a software renderer, and it lets you set the number of cores it used, so we can see how well it scales.

But why would you need to synchronize worker threads when drawing a bunch of triangles?  It turns out some PS2 games like to use the result of a previous draw as the texture for another draw.  Whenever a game does this, one thread could need pixels drawn on another thread, so we have to sync them all up.  PC games do this too, but they'll usually only do this a few times per frame, rendering an entire image before reading it.  When processing effects, PS2 games like to do this on small parts of images at a time, resulting in huge numbers of thread synchronizations.  Ratchet & Clank, which previously saw speed start to die off at around 3 worker threads, requires about 500 synchronizations to draw a single frame.

While this was happening, the worker threads would each see that they have no work to do, and go to sleep themselves.

Well you could say \"just sync less\", and we are working on that (some of the more recent autoflush PRs have helped here), but that's not an especially easy solution.

Maybe not the best use of CPU time, but it brings the time for one round trip communication from 5-10 microseconds down to just 0.2 microseconds, or 200 nanoseconds, an over 10x improvement.  With this, using multiple threads manages to not be slower than 0 threads on even Hitman Blood Money, though it isn't much faster either.  For less sync-intensive games, the falloff point for increasing threads has increased and is now usually in the 4-5 thread area (assuming you have that many cores on your CPU), bringing PAL R&C3's FPS from having dips into the mid 30s to a smooth locked 50 on a Ryzen 5 5600X."),(0,r.kt)(m,{authors:"tellowkrinkle",prNums:"4348",mdxType:"PCSX2PRLink"},"Replace cached GSOffset with live calculations"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The way the PS2's GS stores images in memory is a bit special.

This took up 16kb, but it allowed PCSX2 to go from some pixel coordinates to the memory address of that pixel with two table lookups and two additions.

GSOffset was clearly not made with this in mind.  It didn't provide anything to help with actually using its data, so any code that wanted to use it had to do all the calculations manually.  Some code pulled pointers from the GSOffset and threw them all over the place.

The rest of the calculations (e.g. the left edge calculation) are done whenever they're needed, taking advantage of the fact that images are usually read left to right, top to bottom, so while a 512x512 texture has about 260 thousand pixels, reading it using the GSOffset would only run the slightly slower left edge pixel calculation 512 times.
