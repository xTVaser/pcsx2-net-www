itemprop="articleBody"><p>Many people have visited the forums giving ideas on how and where Pcsx2
should be optimized. While most ideas sound solid on the outside, they
usually will not work in practice for various reasons. This blog will
answer some of those burning questions on what Pcsx2 optimizations are
important and where development work should be put in to make things run
faster. We will touch on why the GPU is the bottleneck on some games and
why the CPU is on others. We will also go into the distribution of
workload of the various components of Pcsx2 as it is computing away. And
most important, we will cover plugin design so that system resources are
distributed nicely.</p><p>First a note to the people that have played around with optimization or
will play around with it. Be careful when measuring performance with
frames per second! If anyone told me their optimization gained 5 fps for
a certain game, I would not understand what that means! Why? Well if a
game went from 5 fps to 10 fps, that means each frame took 200ms and now
it takes 100ms. The optimization saved 100ms of CPU time per frame and
now the game is 2x faster (this doesn&#x27;t happen anymore)! If a game went
from 60 fps to 65 fps, each frame took 16.6 ms and now it takes 15.4 ms.
This is only 1.2 ms of saved time per frame, and the game is only 1.06
times faster. Which optimization do you think is better? Also a 1-2%
speed difference is <strong>not</strong> statistically big enough to say that the
optimization is useful. In fact, the fps counter in the title bar
fluctuates between 1-2% all the time. So you&#x27;ll just be picking up
noise.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pcsx2-optimization-bcf1c3d78caf5fe4df44483e8a882fa4.jpg" width="589" height="341" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The major components of Pcsx2 are shown in the figure. The heart of
Pcsx2 is the dynamic translators of the various PS2 instruction sets,
most often called the recompilers. Note that there are three hearts that
Pcsx2 can be compiled with depending on your CPU: the interpreter
(actually always present), x86, and x86-64. Starting with 0.9.3, Pcsx2
has been retrofitted to compile the interpreter on any little-endian CPU
architecture by compiling with the PCSX2<!-- -->_<!-- -->NORECBUILD define. There is
also the memory management scheme that factors into dynamic translation
since memory accesses can be optimized away instead of calling one huge
MemoryRead(address, value) that redirects execution to the various
hardware components. The DMA connects all data that is passed to the
sub-components of Pcsx2. To the right are the components that are just
interface stubs that interact with the plugins. At the bottom are the
components that are implemented in Pcsx2 without any plugins. The reason
for no plugins is that these components require tight synchronization
between the Pcsx2 hardware registers, so having the component in a
plugin will unnecessarily complicate and slow down things. Note that IPU
can be argued to be a plugin on its own, however the actual MPEG2
decoding part of IPU is not the problem as much as the DMA communication
between it and the EE.</p><p>The Graphysic Synthesizer (GS) plugin accepts a stream of commands to
render geometry to its 4Mb video memory. This stream usually comes from
VU1, VIF, or a DMA transfer. Data from VU1 is usually 3d geometry, data
from VIF/DMA is usually textures or static 2D geometry. From time to
time, the EE can request to read the GS memory from the VIF. Also, the
GS sets various hardware registers so that the EE can synchronize with
it. In MTGS mode, the GS has its own thread to do the stream processing
and these hardware registers are emulated on the main EE thread to avoid
having the EE wait for the GS to complete. In this way, the GS and EE
can be detached and memory won&#x27;t get corrupted. Ideally the GS plugin
should offload as much computation off to the GPU and leave the CPU
alone, this however is possible to a certain degree because of drivers
(see the &quot;Graphics Synthesizer, GPUs, and Dual Cores&quot; blog).</p><p>The Sound Processing Unit (SPU2) plugin accepts a stream of commands
through DMA. The stream usually writes/reads SPU2 memory and sets
various channel modes. These channels play their data on a separate
thread that produces raw PCM data to send to the sound card. At the
moment, the communication between SPU2 and DMA is pretty buggy.</p><p>The CDVD plugin just worries about reading data from ISOs or DVD drives.
Various caching and read-ahead techniques have to be applied in order to
make the reading fast and not noticeable to the user.</p><p>The rest of the plugins are either not implemented like USB and FireWire
or are pretty standard across emulators.</p><p><strong>Optimization</strong></p><p>When running, Pcsx2 spends most of its time in recompiled code (EE/IOP
or VUs). When in the EE recompiler, most components are executed as
hardware registers are written through the memory write functions. About
every 512 EE cycles, the recompilers call cpuBranchTest to update
counters, give IOP enough time to catch up, and perform other system
stuff. The VU programs are usually executed as soon as the program is
started in the VIF. If VU1 is executed, the recompilers don&#x27;t exit until
the VU program exits. If VU0 is executed, only 512 VU cycles are
executed then control is given to the EE so it can catch up
(synchronizing VU0 can be very tricky). IOP recompilers usually don&#x27;t
take up a lot of CPU time. Besides the fact that IOP runs 8 times slower
than EE, it is also a 32bit processor, so things are fairly quick.
The rest of Pcsx2 time is spent in pipelining the data through the
various components. A good amount of time is also spend in the VIF
UNPACK function, however this function is super-optimized (see iVif.cpp
or iVif.S) so nothing can be done about that anymore. IPU also does
MPEG2 decompression, so it is arguably computationally intensive during
movies (however this isn&#x27;t the case at all).</p><p>Because Pcsx2 is written in C/C++, function calls and pipelining is very
fast. Many people believe that rearranging code and optimizing the
calling conventions will speed things up. This is <strong>not</strong> the case at
all. Although there do exist functions that could benefit from some
hand-coded assembly, you will not see a statistical speed difference
because the assembly code might not have improved speed too much, or the
function is not called often enough to really matter. For example, it is
stupid to optimize the recInit function, it is called only once per
game!</p><p><strong>Recompiler Optimizations</strong></p><p>In short, don&#x27;t waste your time optimizing the ADD or MULT instruction
...or any single instruction for that matter. The bottleneck of the
recompilers is the way the registers are allocated. Also, registers are
not tracked across simple blocks meaning that they are all dumped to
memory at the end of each block, which is very suboptimal. My advice is
not to touch any recompiler unless you know what is going on. If you are
inclined to optimize recompilers, do the EE. The VU recompilers are
<strong>very</strong> fast at the moment, so don&#x27;t waste your time because you might
kill compatibility... and IOP is just not worth it. When running a
profiler, you might see the cpuBranchTest function pop up a lot... don&#x27;t
waste your time by rearranging code out of the function or trying to
call the function less frequently, it won&#x27;t work.</p><p><strong>GS plugin optimizations</strong></p><p>There have been various suggestions to use shaders to offload as much
computation as possible. This is exactly what ZeroGS does! In fact,
ZeroGS does it so well that your GPU will cry (hence the name KOSMOS).
The biggest problem with the GS plugin is managing the render targets
and caching the textures. Also, the trick to everything is <strong>never</strong>
(and I really mean never) to transfer GPU memory to system memory. This
problem is actually very common with many games because game developers
just do crazy shit with the GS... sometimes I get the urge to email
companies asking them &#x27;what were you on when you programmed this?&#x27;. This
is the reason why certain games are much slower than others. Sometimes
the problem is fixable, sometimes it isn&#x27;t (this is a good time to
mention that the ocean zbuffer bug in FF12 is exactly due to this
problem... and ZeroGS ingeniously ignores the memory transfer so FF12 is
nice and fast... hence the bug).</p><p>Someone in the forums suggested executing VU1 instructions in the GPU
vertex shaders. If you look at the shader and VU instruction sets,
you&#x27;ll see that they are very similar, so I can understand why someone
would think this. However this is not possible because VUs are <strong>way</strong>
more complex than vertex shaders! In fact, it is suicide to consider the
amount of code reengineering that would have to be done just to get the
GPU to execute a simple VU program... the GPU already has enough work to
do. While on the subject of VU, it is also useful to mention that it is
suicide to even consider putting the VU recompilers in their own CPU
thread that can execute concurrently with the EE! Making things
multi-threaded is tricky because of the data sharing between the two
threads. In fact, putting the VU execution on another thread would
probably slow things down more than speed up. The reason multithreading
on the GS works so well is because the EE doesn&#x27;t have to stop to
synchronize with the GS, all it has to do is copy the stream it wants to
send to the GS in a temporary buffer. The GS plugin will process it when
it gets the time.</p><p><strong>SPU2 optimizations</strong></p><p>Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on here. SPU2 really needs reworking. And it
isn&#x27;t just the plugin, there is a whole synchronization issue with DMA
and SPU2 that has to be taken care of. The SPU2 should be multithreaded
and it shouldn&#x27;t require any huge synchronization with the main thread.
If anyone will work on something, it should be SPU2.</p><p><strong>Other optimizations</strong></p><p>Most other components of Pcsx2 are already pretty optimized. To
summarize, the biggest bottlenecks are the recompilers, GS plugin, and
SPU2. Currently x86-64 versions of the recompilers are being developed.
ZeroGS OpenGL will be released as open source soon, so people can
contribute their own changes if necessary. Actually, future versions of
ZeroGS will have a complex patch system that will enable gamers to tweak
settings so that the game is as fast as possible (even dual core users
can see a big performance gain with the correctly tweaked settings). No
one is maintaining SPU2.... but that will change if this continues.</p><p>The last hope for optimization is actually x86-64. As to how much
performance will increase... not even I know, but we shall see later in
the year when Pcsx2 x64 releases (for Linux too).</p><p><strong>Moral of the blog</strong> Optimization is time consuming and it is more of
an art than science. Programs are developed much faster and have less
bugs when you don&#x27;t have to worry about optimizing (Java is a great
example of a language where it is easy to develop programs, but very
hard to have it run fast.. by design I guess). But no matter the
application, having it go faster is much better than having it go
slower. A lot of game companies spend a lot of money optimizing their
code because it is that important. The reason most newer games have
beautiful graphics running in real-time is not just because GPUs are
getting faster, but also companies are getting better at optimizing
their game engines. For example, games when the PS2 was first released
look inferior to what new PS2 games look today. And with the way things
are going in the software industry, it looks like C++ will stick around
for a very long time because of its optimization capabilities. Learn
C++, there are many books I can recommend, but the best way to learn is
to actually go and program something.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg blogPostFooterDetailsFull_mRVl"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li
